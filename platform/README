Platform configuration files for SCons based build procedure.


<platform>.cfg 
--------------

The <platform>.cfg files in this directory are use to determine
the right settings, libraries, source files etc. on the platform
where you are building Radiance. The build system will select the
right file automatically.

If your platform isn't supported yet, then you can create a new
file with an appropriat name (SCons will tell you what it
expects). Usually, you will start by copying the file of the most
similar suupported platform.

On unix based platforms without a specific config file, the file
"posix.cfg" will be used (which may or may not work well enough).


<platform>_custom.cfg
---------------------

If you want to experiment with changes to the shipped file, then
you can create a copy named <platform>_custom.cfg, and make your
changes there. If such a file exists, then it will be used in
place of the original.


Contents and format
-------------------

Any text starting with a hash character (#) until the end of the
line is ignored as a comment.

A config file consists of several sections, each of which is
introduced by a keyword in brackets.
Within each section, a configuration directive starts with a
keyword and a colon, followed by the specific instructions.


Sections
--------

[install] # directories where to install the software
[build]   # compile and link instruction for production builds
[debug]   # compile and link instruction for debug builds
[code]    # code compatibility configuration


Install section
---------------

  # The root directory of the Radiance installation
RAD_BASEDIR: /home/gm/src/rad/r6b

  # The following are relative to RAD_BASEDIR!
  # The directory for executables 
RAD_BINDIR:  bin
  # The directory for support files (.cal, .pic, .fnt, etc.)
RAD_RLIBDIR: share/lib
  # The directory for the manual files
RAD_MANDIR:  share/man


Debug and Build sections
------------------------

  # The same keywords can be used in both, but usually their
  # assigned values will vary.

  # The compiler to use (example: Gnu gcc)
CC: gcc

  # The directories for C header files (not normally needed).
CPPPATH: 

  # Symbols to define for the preprocessor (example for Cygwin)
CPPDEFINES: freebsd HDSUF=.exe

  # Flags for the C preprocessor (example 
CPPFLAGS:  -O2 -Wall -Wno-uninitialized

  # Flags for the C compiler (example for debug build)
CCFLAGS: -pg

  # The directories for required libraris (not normally needed)
LIBPATH: 

  # Flags for the linker (example for debug build on Windows)
LINKFLAGS: /debug

  # Flags specific to  ezxml.c (example for cygwin/mingw)
EZXML_CPPDEFINES: EZXML_NOMMAP

  # Where to find an installed libtiff and its include files
  # (Not needed when on a standard search path)
  # If no libtiff is found here or on the standard paths, then
  # Radiance will build its own.

The Code section
----------------

  # There should be no need to edit this section in existing
  # config files. If you create a new file for a yet untested 
  # platform, you may need to ask on the dev-list what might
  # work best.

RAD_COMPAT:     # theoretically obsolete (src/common/strcmp.c)
RAD_MATHCOMPAT: # erf.c floating point error function
RAD_ARGSCOMPAT: # fixargv0.c for Windows
RAD_NETCOMPAT:  # [win_]netproc.c for ranimate
RAD_MLIB:       # usually 'm', or any fastlib available
RAD_SOCKETLIB:  # ws_2_32 on Windows (VC links it automatically)
RAD_PROCESS:    # our process abstraction and win_popen()
RAD_PCALLS:     # more custom process abstraction
