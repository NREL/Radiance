This directory contains common auxiliary files used by Radiance.  Files
with the ".cal" suffix specify procedural patterns, textures and coordinate
mappings.  Files with the ".fnt" suffix are font descriptions.  Files
with the ".oct" suffix are compiled scene descriptions for use in
instances.  Files with the ".mat" suffix contain the names of materials
used in the corresponding ".oct" file, for exclusion in the interreflection
calculation using the -aE rendering option.  Files with the ".pic" suffix
are images for patterns.  Note that most pictures are normalized to a
value of 1 rather than the more usual .5, and must be displayed with
the -e -1 option.  This is so the material reflectance given in the
scene description holds true.  (Suggested reflectances are given in
parentheses.)
