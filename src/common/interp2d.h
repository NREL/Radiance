/***************************************************************
 * Typical use is to allocate an INTERP2 struct and assign the
 * spt[] array with the ordered sample locations in x & y.  (The
 * actual orientation of the axes is not important so long as
 * the application is consistent.)  During interpolation, either
 * interp2_weights() is called to obtain a normalized weighting
 * vector for all the samples, or interp2_topsamp() is called to
 * get the most important N samples for the specified location.
 * The weights (and indexes in the case of interp2_topsamp)
 * are then used as coefficients for corresponding sample values
 * in a vector sum together that interpolates the function at that
 * location.  Between the initial allocation call and the first
 * weight evaluation, the dmin member may be adjusted to
 * the distance under which samples will start to merge.  If this
 * parameter is later changed, interp2_analyze() should be called
 * to recompute the interpolant.
 * The smf member sets the smoothing factor for interpolation.
 * The default setting of NI2DSMF produces near-optimal
 * interpolation when well-separated sample values are known
 * precisely.  If a greater degree of mixing is desired, this
 * paremter may be increased and it will affect the next call
 * to interp2_weights() or interp2_topsamp().
