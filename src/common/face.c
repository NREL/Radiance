/*
 *	A face is given as a list of 3D vertices.  The normal
 *  direction and therefore the surface orientation is determined
 *  by the ordering of the vertices.  Looking in the direction opposite
 *  the normal (at the front of the face), the vertices will be
 *  listed in counter-clockwise order.
 *	There is no checking done to insure that the edges do not cross
 *  one another.  This was considered too expensive and should be unnecessary.
 *  The last vertex is automatically connected to the first.
