/*
 *	A procedural pattern can either be a brightness or a
 *  color function.  A brightness function is given as:
 *
 *	modifier brightfunc name
 *	2+ bvarname filename xf
 *	0
 *	n A1 A2 ..
 *
 *  A color function is given as:
 *
 *	modifier colorfunc name
 *	4+ rvarname gvarname bvarname filename xf
 *	0
 *	n A1 A2 ..
 *
 *  Filename is the name of the file where the variable definitions
 *  can be found.  The list of real arguments can be accessed by
 *  definitions in the file.  The xf is a transformation
 *  to get from the original coordinates to the current coordinates.
