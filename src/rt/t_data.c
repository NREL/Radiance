 *	A stored texture is specified as follows:
 *
 *	modifier texdata name
 *	8+ xfunc yfunc zfunc xdfname ydfname zdfname vfname v0 v1 .. xf
 *	0
 *	n A1 A2 .. An
 *
 *  Vfname is the name of the file where the variable definitions
 *  can be found.  The list of real arguments can be accessed by
 *  definitions in the file.  The dfnames are the data file
 *  names.  The dimensions of the data files and the number
 *  of variables must match.  The funcs take three arguments to produce
 *  interpolated values from the file.  The xf is a transformation
 *  to get from the original coordinates to the current coordinates.
