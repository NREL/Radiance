A general scheme has been defined for writing translators from CAD
files to Radiance.  This scheme should be used by anyone who writes a
new translator, since it is both useful and general.

One of the biggest problems encountered when importing CAD descriptions
to a lighting simulation (or any good rendering program) is assigning
materials to the surface geometry.  Even if the creator of the model
has been careful to make 3d surfaces instead of points and lines, most
people don't even think about what a surface is made of until they're
all done.  At that point, of course, it's too late.  Even if the user
does give a little thought to materials, most CAD systems only permit
the assignment of a color index to each surface, which is a start but
far short of the information needed to make a good simulation.

There are only a few CAD systems that "do the right thing" and allow the
user to assign material identifiers to objects and individual surfaces.
Such a program, GDS for example, makes writing a translator almost
trivial, since the material identifiers can refer back to a library of
materials maintained by the user, or even imported from the CAD system.

Most CAD programs, like AutoCAD or Architrion, don't really use the
notion of materials in their models at all.  Instead, they
differentiate surfaces by layer, color, block name, and so forth, none
of which clearly makes sense to use as a material identifier.  Even if
the user creates a model with an intent to perform lighting
simulations, he or she has no way to assign materials directly to the
objects in the model.

The only general solution is to use every available piece of information
from the CAD model to assign materials.  We can do this by using a set
of mapping rules, created somehow by the user.  (We are working on
a HyperCard interface for selecting materials that should be very nice
if we ever finish it.)  The mapping rules are an ordered list of
materials and the conditions a surface must satisfy in order to have
that material.

For example, if we wanted all surfaces in the Block "thingy" with the
Color 152 to use the material "wood", and all other surfaces to use the
material "default", we would create the following mapping file:

	default ;
	wood (Block "thingy") (Color 152) ;

All surfaces would satisfy the first set of conditions (which is empty),
but only the surfaces in Block "thingy" with Color 152 would satisfy the
second set of conditions.

Each rule can have up to one condition per qualifier, and different
translators will use different qualifiers.  A qualifier is simply an
attribute that can be used to distinguish surfaces, such as Color,
Layer, Reference ID, etc.  A condition is either a single value for a
specific attribute, or an integer range of values.  (Integer ranges are
specified in brackets and separated by a colon, eg. [-15:27], and are
always inclusive.)  A semicolon is used to indicate the end of a rule,
which can extend over several lines if necessary.

The semantics of the rule are such that "and" is the implied conjunction
between conditions.  Thus, it makes no sense to have more than one
condition in a rule for a given qualifier.  If the user wants the same
material to be used for surfaces that satisfy different conditions,
they simply add more rules.  For example, if the user also wanted
surfaces in Block "yohey" with Colors between 50 and 100 to use "wood",
they would add the following rule to the end of the example above:

	wood (Color [50:100]) (Block "yohey") ;

Note that the order of conditions in a rule is irrelevant.  However,
the order of rules is very important, since the last rule satisfied
determines which material a surface is assigned.

By convention, the identifier "void" is used to delete unwanted
surfaces.  It is used in a rule as any other material, but it has the
effect of excluding all matching surfaces from the translator output.
For example, the following mapping would delete all surfaces in the
Layer 2 except those with the color "beige", to which it would assign 
the material "beige_cloth", and all other surfaces would be "tacky":

	tacky ;
	void (Layer 2) ;
	beige_cloth (Layer 2) (Color "beige") ;

Hopefully, the meaning of the mapping rules is now clear, so we can
discuss ways to help the user create the mapping for a given model.

A translator should provide at least two basic options.  The first
option, "-n", simply reads the CAD input file and creates a list of
qualifiers and values that can be used to differentiate surfaces in the
model.  The output of the program with "-n" should be something like:

	filename "Example Input File"
	filetype "Architrion"
	qualifier Color begin
	35
	[100:110]
	200
	end
	qualifier RefId begin
	1103
	[5306:5307]
	"BIG Things"
	"little Things"
	end
	EOF

This information can be used either by the user or by a program such as
HyperCard to create the rules for assigning materials to surfaces in
the file.  (The "EOF" is literally there, since HyperCard has trouble
detecting the end of file.)

The second option, "-m mapfile" is used to specify the mapping file to
be used by the translator.  If no mapfile is provided by the user, the
translator should have a standard mapping to assign material names
based on some set of default paramters.  (For example, arch2rad uses
color alone to assign materials "c0" through "c255".)  To accompany the
default mapping, there should be a default materials file with
corresponding definitions.  These files should be placed in the
Radiance library directory under "lib" (ie. "/usr/local/lib/ray/lib").

To just look at an Architrion building, a user might issue the following
commands:

	oconv '\!gensky 6 15 12' /usr/local/lib/ray/lib/arch.mat \
			'\!arch2rad model.txt' > model.oct
	rview -av 3 3 3 -vp -20 -20 5 -vd 1 1 0 model.oct

Note that by giving oconv commands instead of input files, no temporary
files (other than the octree) are necessary.  In a more complete
example, the user might first create a qualifier list, then run the
HyperCard stack for assigning materials, then convert the model
with his own materials file, thus:

	arch2rad -n model.txt > model.qual
	HyperCard MatPick.stack		# creates model.map from model.qual
	arch2rad -m model.map model.txt > model.rad
	oconv source.rad materials.rad model.rad > model.oct
	rview -vf model.vp model.oct

To write a new translator, include the "trans.h" file in ray/src/cv and
link with trans.o and the standard Radiance library.  You will need to
define your own list of valid qualifiers and use the following routines
from trans.c:

	fgetid(ID *idp; char *dls; FILE *fp)
	/*
	 * Read an id (either a string or an integer) from fp
	 * up to a character in dls.  The delimiter will be discarded.
	 * Return EOF at end of file, 0 otherwise.  You should free
	 * the id with the macro doneid(idp).
	 */

	int
	findid(IDLIST *ilp; ID *idp; int insert)
	/*
	 * Find (or insert) idp in the list ilp.  Uses binary search
	 * to find (or if insert is true, insert) an id in a sorted id
	 * list.  Returns index into ilp->id, or -1 if not found and no
	 * insert.
	 */

	int
	idcmp(ID *id1, *id2)
	/*
	 * Compares two identifiers.  Numbers compare less than strings.
	 */

	write_quals(QLIST *qlp; IDLIST idl[]; FILE *fp)
	/*
	 * Write out qualifiers in array of id lists idl[] to fp.
	 * The qualifier list qlp is used to determine how many and
	 * what to call the qualifiers.
	 */

	RULEHD *
	getmapping(char *file; QLIST *qlp)
	/*
	 * Read mapping rules from "file" and create a list of rules
	 * in reverse order.  Prints various syntax errors using eputs()
	 * and calls quit() if there's a serious problem with the input.
	 */

	matchid(ID *idp; IDMATCH *idm)
	/*
	 * Checks to see if idp matches the id or range in idm.
	 */

Good luck!  I will be happy to answer questions (GJWard@lbl.gov).
