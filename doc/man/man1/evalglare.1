.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
evalglare determines and evaluates glare sources within a 180 degree
fish\-eye\-image, given in the RADIANCE image format (.pic or .hdr).
The image should be rendered as fish eye (e.g.
using the \-vta or \[en]vth option) using 180 degree for the horizontal and
vertical view angle (\-vv =180, \-vh=180).
Due to performance reasons of the evalglare code, the image should be
smaller than 1200x1200 pixels. The recommended size is 800x800 pixels.
In the first step, the program uses a given threshold to determine all
glare sources.
Three different threshold methods are implemented.
The recommended method is to define a task area by \-t or \-T option.
In this (task) area the average luminance is calculated Each pixel,
exceeding this value multiplied by the \-b factor [default=5] is treated
as a potential glare source.
The other two methods are described below [see \-b].
In the second step the program tries to merge glare source pixels to one
glare source, when they are placed nearby each other.
This merging is performed in\-between a search area, given by an opening
angle (\-r, default =0.2 in radiant).
If a check file is written (\-c fname), the detected glare sources will
be colored to different colors where the rest of the image is set to
gray.
The luminance values of all pixels are kept to the initial value.
The color is chosen by chance, no significance is given by the color.
To enable a unform coloring for all glare sources, the \-u option can be used.
Luminance peaks can be extracted to separate glare sources by using the
\-y or \-Y value option (default since version v0.9c).
Default value (\-y) is 50000 cd/m2, can be changed by using \-Y value.
A smoothing option (\-s) counts initial non\-glare source pixels to
glare sources, when they are surrounded by a glare source.
.PP
The program calculates the daylight glare probability (DGP) as well as
other glare indexes (dgi,ugr,vcp,cgi) to the standard output.
The DGP describes the fraction of persons disturbed, caused by glare from
daylight (range 0...1).
Values lower than 0.2 are out of the range of the user assessment tests,
where the program is based on and should be interpreted carefully. 
A low light correction is applied to the DGP when the vertical illumiance is lower than 500 lux.
By the use of \-g or \-G the field of view is cut according the the definition of Guth.
The option \-B angle (in rad) calculates the average luminance of a horizontal band. 
In the case of non\-180 degree images, an external measured illuminance value
can be provided by using the \[en]i or \[en]I option.
The use of the \[en]I option enables the filling up of images, which are
horizontally cut.
The age correction is not supported any more and disabled.
If the option \-d is used, all found glare sources and their position,
size, and luminance values are printed to the standard output, too.
The last line gives following values: 1.
dgp, 2.
average luminance of image,3.
vertical eye illuminance, 4.
background luminance, 5.
direct vertical eye illuminance, 6.
dgi, 7.
ugr, 8.
vcp, 9.
cgi, 10.
average luminance of all glare sources, 11.
sum of solid angles of all glare sources 12.
Veiling luminance (disability glare) 13.
x\-direction of glare source 14.
y\-direction of glare source 15.
z\-direction of glare source 16.
band luminance
.PP
The program is based on the studies from J.
Christoffersen and J.
Wienold (see \“Evaluation methods and development of a new glare
prediction model for daylight environments with the use of CCD cameras
and RADIANCE\“ , Energy and Buildings, 2006.

Threshold factor; if factor >100, it is used as constant threshold in
cd/m2, regardless if a task position is given or not if factor is <= 100
and a task position is given, this factor multiplied by the average task
luminance will be used as threshold for detecting the glare sources if
factor is <= 100 and no task position is given, this factor multiplied
by the average luminance in the entire picture will be used as threshold
for detecting the glare sources, default value=5.
