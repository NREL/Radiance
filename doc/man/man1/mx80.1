.SH NAME
mx80 - output metafile to Epson mx-80
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mx80
[
.B \-c | \-r
]
file ..
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mx80
reads each metafile
.I file
in sequence and converts it to output suitable for the Epson line
of printers, specifically the mx-80 and fx-80.
If the option
.I c
is specified, the input files are only conditioned for output, ie.
expanded and sorted (see pexpand and psort).  This is useful if many
copies of the same output is desired.
If the option
.I r
is instead specified, the input is assumed already to be conditioned.
If no input files are specified, the standard input is read.
.TP 10n
.BR \-c
Condition the input only.
.TP
.BR \-r
Input is already conditioned, output only.
.SH EXAMPLE
To print the plot file test.plt:
.IP "" .2i
bgraph test.plt | output mx80
