.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gendaylit
produces a RADIANCE scene description based on an angular distribution of the
daylight sources (direct+diffuse) for the given atmospheric conditions 
(direct and diffuse component of the solar radiation), date and
local standard time. The default output is the radiance of the sun (direct) and the sky (diffus)
integrated over the visible spectral range (380-780 nm). We have used the
calculation of the sun's position and the ground brightness models which
were programmed in
.I gensky.						

The diffuse angular distribution is calculated using the Perez et al.
sky luminance distribution model (see Solar Energy Vol. 50, No. 3, pp. 235-245, 1993) which, quoting Perez,
describes "the mean instantaneous sky luminance angular distribution patterns for all sky
conditions from overcast to clear, through partly cloudy, skies". The correctness of the 
resulting sky radiance/luminance values in this simulation is ensured through the normalization of the modelled 
sky diffuse to the measured sky diffuse irradiances/illuminances.

The direct radiation is understood here as the radiant flux coming from the sun
and an area of approximately 3 degrees around the sun (World Meteorological Organisation specifications
for measuring the direct radiation. The aperture angle of a pyrheliometer is approximately 6 degrees). 
To simplify the calculations for the direct radiation, the sun is represented as a disk and no   
circumsolar radiation is modelled in the 3 degrees around the sun. This means that
all the measured/evaluated direct radiation is added to the 0.5 degree sun source. 

.I The direct and diffuse 
.I solar irradiances/illuminances 
.I are the inputs needed 
.I for the calculation.
These quantities are the commonly accessible data from radiometric measurement centres, conversion models 
(e.g. global irradiance to direct irradiance), or from the Test Reference Year. The use of such
data is the recommended method for achieving the most accurate simulation results.


The atmospheric conditions are modelled with the Perez et al. parametrization  
(see Solar Energy Vol. 44, No 5, pp. 271-289, 1990), which is dependent on the values for
the direct and the diffuse irradiances. The three parameters
are epsilon, delta and the solar zenith angle. "Epsilon variations express the transition from 
a totally overcast sky (epsilon=1) to a low turbidity clear sky (epsilon>6); delta 
variations reflect the opacity/thickness of the clouds". Delta can vary from 0.05
representing a dark sky to 0.5 for a very bright sky. Not every combination of
epsilon, delta and solar zenith angle is possible. For a clear day, if 
epsilon and the solar zenith angle are known, then delta can be determined. For intermediate or overcast
days, the sky can be dark or bright, giving a range of possible values for delta
when epsilon and the solar zenith are fixed. The relation between epsilon and delta
is represented in a figure on page 393 in Solar Energy Vol.42, No 5, 1989,
or can be obtained from the author of this RADIANCE extension upon request. Note that the 
epsilon parameter is a function of the solar zenith angle. It means that a clear day 
will not be defined by fixed values of epsilon and delta. Consequently the input
parameters, epsilon, delta and the solar zenith angle, have to be determined on a graph.
It might be easier to work with the measured direct and diffuse components (direct normal irradiance/illuminance
and diffuse horizontal irradiance/illuminance) than with the epsilon and delta parameters.


The conversion of irradiance into illuminance for the direct and the diffuse
components is determined by the luminous efficacy models of Perez et al. (see 
Solar Energy Vol. 44, No 5, pp. 271-289, 1990). To convert the luminance values
into radiance integrated over the visible range of the spectrum, 
we devide the luminance by the white light efficacy factor of  
179 lm/W. This is consistent with the RADIANCE calculation because the luminance
will be recalculated from the radiance integrated over the visible range by :

luminance = radiance_integrated_over_visible_range * 179   or

luminance = (RED*.263 + GREEN*.655 + BLUE*.082) * 179    with the capability
to model colour (where radiance_integrated_over_visible_range == (RED + GREEN + BLUE)/3).

From 
.I gensky
, if the hour is preceded by a plus sign ('+'), then it is interpreted
as local solar time instead of standard time.
The second form gives the solar angles explicitly.
The altitude is measured in degrees above the horizon, and the
azimuth is measured in degrees west of South.
.PP
The x axis points east,
the y axis points north, and the z axis corresponds to the zenith.
The actual material and surface(s) used for the sky is left
up to the user.
.PP
In addition to the specification of
a sky distribution function,
.I gendaylit
suggests an ambient value in a comment at the beginning of the
description to use with the
.I \-av
option of the RADIANCE rendering programs.
(See rview(1) and rpict(1).)
This value is the cosine-weighted radiance of the sky in
W/sr/m^2.
.PP

can be used with the following input parameters. They offer three possibilities
to run it: with the Perez parametrization, with the irradiance values
and with the illuminance values.

The dark overcast sky (corresponding to the CIE overcast standard, see CIE draft standard,
Pub. No. CIE DS 003, 1st Edition, 1994) is obtained by:
.IP "" .2i
