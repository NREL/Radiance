.SH NAME
pkgBSDF - package BSDFs provided as XML for Radiance
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pkgBSDF
[
.B \-i
][
.B \-s
]
.B "bsdf.xml .."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I PkgBSDF
takes one or more XML files, each describing the bidirectional scattering
distribution function of a surface or geometric system, and packages
them into RADIANCE scene descriptions.
One rectangle is produced for each BSDF that has
no detail geometry and/or no rear-side reflectance distribution.
If both front and back reflectance distributions are present with
detail geometry, then two rectangles will be used to sandwich
the geometry extracted from the BSDF file.
.PP
The
.I \-i
option causes
.I pkgBSDF
to produce frozen octree instances for any detail geometry,
which may reduce memory requirements in scenes with many
references to the same complex BSDF object.
.PP
Normally,
.I pkgBSDF
produces one RADIANCE scene file for each XML input, replacing
the required '.xml' suffix with '.rad' in the same directory.
The
.I \-s
option sends the RADIANCE scene description to the standard
output rather than writing it to a file, but only works
for a single XML input.
Any instance octree is still written out to a file generated
by replacing the '.xml' suffix with '.oct' in the same directory.
.SH EXAMPLE
Package all the XML files in the current directory as Radiance
scene files, employing frozen octree instances for any
detail geometry:
.IP "" .2i
pkgBSDF -i *.xml
