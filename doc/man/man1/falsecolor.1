.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Falsecolor
produces a false color picture for lighting analysis.
Input is a rendered Radiance picture.
.PP
By default, luminance is displayed on a linear scale from 0 to 1000 nits, where
dark areas are blue and brighter areas move through the spectrum to red.
A different scale can be given with the
.I \-s
option.
The default multiplier is 179, which converts from radiance or irradiance
to luminance or illuminance, respectively.
A different multiplier can be given with
.I \-m
to get daylight factors or whatever.
For a logarithmic rather than a linear mapping, the
.I \-log
option can be used, where
.I decades
is the number of decades below the maximum scale desired.
.PP
A legend is produced for the new image with a label given by the
.I \-l
option.
The default label is "Nits", which is appropriate for standard Radiance
images.
If the
.I -i
option of
.I rpict(1)
was used to produce the image, then the appropriate label would be "Lux".
.PP
If contour lines are desired rather than just false color, the
.I \-cl
option can be used.
These lines can be placed over another Radiance picture using the
.I -p
option.
If the input picture is given with
.I \-ip
instead of
.I \-i,
then it will be used both as the source of values and as the picture
to overlay with contours.
The
.I \-cb
option produces contour bands instead of lines, where the thickness of
the bands is related to the rate of change in the image.
The
.I \-n
option can be used to change the number of contours (and corresponding
legend entries) from the default value of 8.
.PP
The
.I \-e
option causes extrema points to be printed on the brightest and
darkest pixels of the input picture.
.PP
The remaining options,
.I "\-r, \-g,"
and
.I \-b
are for changing the mapping of values to colors.
These are expressions of the variable 
.I v,
where
.I v
varies from 0 to 1.
These options are not recommended for the casual user.
.PP
If no
.I \-i
or
.I \-ip
option is used, input is taken from the standard input.
The output image is always written to standard output, which should
be redirected.
.SH EXAMPLES
To create a false color image directly from
.I rpict(1):
.IP "" .2i
rpict -vf default.vp scene.oct | falsecolor > scene.pic
.PP
To create a logarithmic contour plot of illuminance values on a
Radiance image:
.IP "" .2i
rpict -i -vf default.vp scene.oct > irrad.pic
.br
rpict -vf default.vp scene.oct > rad.pic
.br
falsecolor -i irrad.pic -p rad.pic -cl -log 2 -l Lux > lux.pic
